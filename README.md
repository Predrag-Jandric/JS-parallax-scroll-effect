## Welcome! 👋

- Interesting projects in which I [learn from this video](https://youtu.be/TawH-AqHTXc) how parallax on scroll works with multiple images and text combined together. The effect is working. However, as the container has "mix-blend-mode", the color of the text which is the child element cannot have normal colors... Despite trying to solve this, i couldn't do it.

### Languages and features 👨‍💻 

- Sass: nesting, mixins, variables, media queries.
- JS: position manipulation 

Thanks for checking out my projects.
